I specialise in writing scalable CSS, maintainable code and performance optimisation and offer coding work, trainings or code audits for these topics.

### Front-end Expertise

As a freelancer, I usually am hired by companies who need additional people to reduce individual workload and finish their projects in time or by companies needing a specific expert in web performance optimisation, scaling CSS, or writing maintainable, accessible code.

I heavily invest time into open-source work, web standards, and in sharing my knowledge with other people to improve the state of the industry.
